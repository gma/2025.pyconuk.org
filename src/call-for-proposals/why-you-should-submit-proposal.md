  <h3>Everyone has something to share</h3>
  <p>You might be a world-class expert or you might be a new beginner. Either way, you almost certainly have <strong>something worth sharing</strong> with other people.</p>
  <p>It could be a story, a lesson, an idea, an experience, a protest, a discovery, a failure, a creation, a work in progress, a sucess, a challenge- <strong>anything at all.</strong></p>
  <p>The perspectives and experiences of new contributors are <strong>just as valuable as</strong> (and sometimes more surprising than) those of seasoned contributors.</p>

<div class="box box_blue">
  <h3>Pycon UK has a large and enthusiastic audience</h3>
  <p>Whatever it is you have to share, <strong>it's going to strike a chord</strong> with at least someone in our audience. Your contribution, however modest or specialised you think it might be, could be exactly what someone else has been waiting for.</p>
  <p>A session at PyCon UK is an excellent way to <strong>raise interest in a project</strong>, <strong>find new collaborators</strong>, or <strong>draw attention to a problem.</strong></p>
  <p>Our audience is <strong>supportive, friendly and respectful</strong>, and people are there precisely because they want to hear about new things that they can become involved in and make a difference to.</p>
</div>

<div class="box box_red">
  <h3>We're committed to making it a positive experience</h3>
  <p>We know how much effort and time our contributors put into their sessions. For many of them, it's a very big deal to stand up in front of an audience and speak publicly.</p>
  <p>We want you to remember the experience as a positive one, and <strong>to want to repeat it</strong>.</p>
</div>

<div class="box box_yellow">
  <h3>Our speakers keep coming back</h3>
  <p><strong>People love speaking at PyCon UK</strong>, and keep coming back for more (typically, with increasingly ambitious and audacious proposals).</p>
  <p>This includes many for whom it was their first speaking experience. <strong>There's hardly a better way to build your skills and confidence</strong> than by getting started at a PyCon UK.</p>

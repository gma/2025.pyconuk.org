This year's conference is being held at {{ links.contactmcr }} in Manchester.

Our venue is on the south side of the city, close to Manchester University, with good [public transport links](https://contactmcr.com/visit/getting-here) close by.

The site has accessible toilets, baby changing facilities, a lift to all floors, and great coffee.

Parking isn't generally available, but parking for disabled visitors can be arranged in advance (see below).

### Disabled parking

If you'd like access to disabled parking at the venue, please email <hires@contactmcr.com> to arrange it in advance. In your email, please mention:

- that you're attending PyCon
- the dates that you'll need to be able to park
- your vehicle type and registration number
- the driver's name

## Accommodation

Before choosing a place to stay, it's worth bearing in mind how far it is from the venue and (if you think you might go) to the city centre.

Most places are walkable from the venue if you don't mind a 20-30 minute walk, but you can also use taxis, buses, or hop on a "Beryl bike" (Manchester's bike hire scheme).

### Hotels

There are a couple of hotels just over a 10 minute walk from the venue:

- [Travelodge (Upper Brook Street)] is a [12 minute walk][travelodge map] to the east of the venue. While it's nearby, note that if you'd like to venture into the city centre during your stay that it's not quite so well located. For those arriving by train, it's a 30 minute walk from Manchester Piccadilly station.

- [Hyatt Regency] (4 star, so more expensive) is [a similar distance away][hyatt map] from the venue, but is closer to the city. It's a 20 minute walk from Piccadilly station.

There are a lot of other choices if none of those take your fancy. This [list of hotels] will give you some more ideas (the most expensive ones are at the top, with a budget-friendly section further down the page).

### Hostels

The [Manchester YHA] is in a nice location. It's a 40 minute walk to the venue, 20 minutes to Oxford Road station, 30 minutes to Piccadilly station, and 35 minutes to Victoria station.

The [Malacuna Hostel] (previously known as [Hilton Chambers]) is also worth considering. It's on the edge of Manchester's [Northern Quarter], which is where you'll find an eclectic mix of shops, plenty of bars, and lots of restaurants (it can be quite lively in the evenings). It's on the far side of the city centre from the venue, so a 40 minute walk away (or 10 minutes on a Beryl bike). But it's only an 11 minute walk to Piccadilly station, or 12 minutes to Victoria station.

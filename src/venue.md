This year's conference is being held at {{ links.contactmcr }} in Manchester.

Contact is close to Manchester University, with good [public transport links](https://contactmcr.com/visit/getting-here) close by. On site disabled parking is available along with accessible toilets, baby changing facilities, a lift to all floors, and great coffee.

## Travel

Manchester has an airport, several train stations, and is easily accessed by road.

The **venue doesn't have a car park**, so if you're arriving by car it would be worth choosing a hotel with parking.

The nearest train station is on Oxford Road, a [20 minute walk] to the north of the venue. Trains from the south (and the airport) arrive at Piccadilly (a [30 minute walk]). Trains arriving from the north often arrive at Victoria Station (a [55 minute walk]).

[55 minute walk]: https://maps.app.goo.gl/GMp5tBKJCVykA6NUA

If you're flying to Manchester Airport, note that you'll find both a train and a tram that will take you into the city centre. The train (20 minutes to Manchester Piccadilly) is significantly faster. Taxis are also available, and take around 25 minutes.

## Accommodation

The venue is on the south side of the city, while most of the other places you're likely to want to get to are towards the city centre. It's worth bearing this in mind while choosing a hotel, particularly if you're aiming to walk to/from the venue.

This is a [good list of nearby hotels] (scroll down if you're interested in budget friendly options).

### Bars and pubs

Times in brackets will give you a feel for how far these places are from the venue.

**Close to Contact Theatre** (and the University) you'll find:

- [Big Hands] is popular with music lovers. It gets lively after a gig at the nearby Manchester Academy, and has a roof garden. And it's right by the venue. (2 minutes walk)

- [Sandbar] have an excellent choice of beers and whiskies, and also serves pizza. It's very popular with local academics and students, and has a nice atmosphere. If it's too busy, be sure to check out [The Deaf Institute] over the road. (14 minutes walk)

**Slightly further towards the centre:**

- [Lass O'Gowrie] is an old brick building on the banks of the River Medlock, half way between Oxford Road and Piccadilly stations. It's known for its old tiles and fittings, and Guinness. They also do guest beers and food. (20 minutes walk)

- [The Temple] (of Convenience) is a sister of Big Hands (mentioned above), and is another popular one with local musicians. It's not very big (it was once a public toilet), but it's just off Oxford Road and worth a look if you're passing. If you can't get a seat, nip up the road to "the Pev". (22 minute walk)

**Nearer to the city centre**, these are all worth a mention:

- One of Manchester's most famous pubs, [Peveril of the Peak] (a.k.a. the Pev) dates back to 1830. It's known for the beautiful tile-clad frontage, but inside you'll find plenty of old wood, stained glass, and bench seating. According to Wikipedia, CAMRA consider it to have an "interior of exceptional national historic importance". The landlady has been there over 50 years, and apparently, there's a ghost. (26 minute walk)

- [The Britons Protection] is another proper old pub with plenty of nooks and crannies to explore. Dating back to 1795, there's some serious history behind this one. It was used to recruit soldiers during the Napoleonic wars, and there are rumours that people injured in the nearby Peterloo Massacre (1819) were treated on the bar. They've got good beers and a couple of hundred whiskeys to choose from. In short, it's a classic. (28 minute walk)

- [City Arms] is just off St Peter's Square (which makes it very central) and is a reliably good choice. It's almost 200 years old, has a good atmosphere, and two rooms. There are normally several different beers on tap (including one vegan option) and around 150 gins. (30 minutes walk)

Once you've got into the city centre there are loads of places to choose from.

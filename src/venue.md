## Accommodation

Before choosing a place to stay, it's worth bearing in mind how far it is from the venue and (if you think you might go) to the city centre.

Most hotels are within a 20-30 minute walk of the venue, but you can also use taxis, [buses], or hop on a "Beryl bike" (Manchester's bike hire scheme).

### Hotels

There are a couple of hotels just over a 10 minute walk from the venue:

- [Travelodge (Upper Brook Street)] is a [12 minute walk][travelodge map] to the east of the venue. While it's nearby, note that if you'd like to venture into the city centre during your stay that it's not quite so well located. For those arriving by train, it's a 30 minute walk (or a 5 minute taxi ride) from Manchester Piccadilly station.

- [Hyatt Regency] (4 star, so more expensive) is [a similar distance away][hyatt map] from the venue, but is closer to the city. It's a 20 minute walk (or 5 minute taxi ride) from Piccadilly station.

You've got more choice if you opt for a hotel close to the city centre. These are a 20-25 minute walk from the venue and about 10 minutes from Piccadilly station:

- [ibis Manchester Centre] on Portland Street ([map][ibis map])
- [Holiday Inn Express] on Oxford Road ([map][holiday inn map])
- [Premier Inn Manchester Centre] on Portland Street ([map][premier map])
- [Maldron Manchester City Centre] on Charles Street ([map][maldron map])

### Hostels

The [Manchester YHA] is in a nice location. It's a [40 minute walk][yha map] to the venue, 20 minutes to Oxford Road station, 30 minutes to Piccadilly station, and 35 minutes to Victoria station.

The [Malacuna Hostel] (previously known as [Hilton Chambers]) is also worth considering. It's on the edge of Manchester's [Northern Quarter], which is where you'll find an eclectic mix of shops, plenty of bars, and lots of restaurants (it can be quite lively in the evenings). It's on the far side of the city centre from the venue, so a [40 minute walk away][malacuna map] (or 10 minutes on a Beryl bike). But it's only an 11 minute walk to Piccadilly station, or 12 minutes to Victoria station.

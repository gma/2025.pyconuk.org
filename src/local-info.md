### Getting around

Manchester has good bus and tram networks, but (due to the location of the venue) it's likely that **most of the journeys you're likely to make will be best undertaken [by bus], or on foot**. There's also a [hire bike scheme](#by-hire-bike), and taxis are obviously an option too!

[by bus]: #by-bus

#### By bus

Key things to know:

- You can **buy a ticket on the bus** with cash, a contactless card, or ApplePay/GooglePay (see the [TfGM page on contactless payments] for full details)
- A **single journey costs £2** – you get a paper ticket that's valid on multiple buses for up to an hour
- A **1-day pass costs £5**
- [The venue](/venue) is on Oxford Road (to the south of the city centre) and is close to several bus stops

The **easiest way to plan a bus journey** (and find the right stop) is to **install Manchester's [Bee Network app]** (you don't need to create an account).

You can also use general purpose apps like Google Maps or Citymapper, or the [web based journey planner][tfgm planner], but **the Bee app is best for**:

- listing the bus services that are suitable for your journey
- finding the right bus stop
- live updates showing where your next bus is (see the bus tracking video on the [app's page][Bee Network app])

[Transport for Greater Manchester][TfGM] have a page that documents [accessibility on the buses].

Note that there are a couple of **[free buses] that are useful for travelling around the city centre** (though they don't come close to the venue).

#### By tram

The trams don't come close to the venue, but if you want to visit somewhere slightly further afield the tram is a great option.

You can purchase a paper ticket from a machine on the platform, or pay by contactless when getting on/off a tram. See the [TfGM] page on [contactless payments] for details of how contactless fees are calculated (and what happens if you forget to tap out at the end of your journey!).

As with the bus, the [Bee Network app] is a good way to plan a journey on the trams, though Google Maps also works well.

TfGM have a page that documents [accessibility on the trams].

#### By hire bike

[Manchester's hire bike scheme] is sponsored by Starling Bank, and the bikes are operated by Beryl.

Key things to know:

- You need to **install the [Starling Bank Bikes app]** in order to hire a bike
- Pedal bikes cost **50p to unlock**, then **5p per minute to ride**
- **E-bikes** cost **£1 to unlock** and **10p per minute to ride**
- You can see a map of where the nearest bike stations are (and how many bikes are currently available) in the app
- The app gives you a brief tutorial on how to unlock and lock a bike the first time you run it

The conference **venue is just off Oxford Road**, which is **well served by cycle lanes** and is largely traffic free during the day. There are a couple of **hire bike stations nearby** (they're visible on the maps in both the [Starling][Starling Bank Bikes app] and [Bee Network][Bee Network app] apps).

### Food and drink

#### Cafés and coffee

In the order of increasing distance from the venue (and on the way if you're walking from some of our [suggested hotels]), we've got:

- [brew] is on site at the venue, on the ground floor. They serve coffee, sandwiches, toasties, and "treats".
- [Bold St Coffee] is a 10 minute walk north of the venue ([map][bold st map]), opens at 8am, does a decent coffee, and **laptops are welcome** (with personal workstations and charging points).
- [Half Dozen Other] is further north up Oxford Rd, and will be enjoyed by pastry fans ([map][half dozen map])
- Another great choice is [Federal], just a little bit further north again ([map][federal map]). They do a punchy flat white, and (if you can get a table) a good breakfast.

Slightly further north (near to some the [suggested hotels]) we've also got:

- [Foundation Coffee House] on Whitworth St ([map][foundation map]), which is also **laptop friendly**
- Pollen Bakery inside the Kampus building ([map][pollen map]), which is good for dog-spotting

If none of those are nearby, see [these recommendations][coffee finest] from the [Manchester's Finest].

#### Supermarkets

If you need anything during the conference, there are a couple of supermarkets on the other side of Oxford Road:

- Sainsbury's Local ([map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AWBBuMCF4PMgAENC7), 4 minute walk)
- Morrisons ([map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/daxdhSmgbgWJej1w5), 5 minute walk)

#### Places to eat

If you fancy finding somewhere to eat **during the day** and fancy a stroll, these are fairly close to the venue:

- [Manchester Museum] have a [good café] ([6 minute walk][museum map])
- [Whitworth Art Gallery] has a [very nice café] overlooking Whitworth Park ([8 minute walk][whitworth map]), but note that there's often a queue for a table. They stop serving at 3.30pm.
- [The 8th Day] vegan & vegetarian shop/deli has a [Plant Based Café][8th day cafe] downstairs that's open from 11am to 3pm. There's a salad bar, and a small selection of hot meals, all cooked on site. ([14 minute walk][8th day map])

**In the evenings**, there are *a lot* of options. Feel free to **ask for advice in the #ask-the-locals** channel on the conference Discord server, or find out where others are headed in the **#social-activities channel**.

But to give you some ideas:

- **Some of the bars** below **serve food** (look for "serve food" in bold)
- Oxford Road Corridor have a [list of restaurants near Oxford Road][corridor restaurants].
- [Mackie Mayor] is an upmarket food hall, with several different restaurants operating under one roof. With long tables and plenty of choice, it's good for bigger groups. There's a decent range of wine and beer on offer too. It's on the north side of the city (so not really walkable) but it's worth considering if you're happy to do a 25 minute journey [by bus](#by-bus) and on foot.

#### Bars and pubs

There are a lot of places to go for a chat/drink. Where do you start?!

Bear in mind that Manchester University's new intake of **students will be arriving back in the city over the weekend**, so places near the University might be busier than usual. We've organised our suggestions together according to how far from the venue (and University) they are.

**If places are too busy and you need to relocate**, these sites will help you find somewhere suitable:

- Oxford Road Corridor have a [big list of bars near Oxford Road][corridor bars]
- [Tap Tourist] is a guide to Manchester's craft beer (including a list of the [city's breweries], many of which have large tap rooms, and [places serving gluten free beer][gf craft beer])

[gf craft beer]: https://taptourist.co.uk/manchester-gluten-free-beer

**Here are our suggestions** around the venue and Oxford Road (times in brackets will give you a feel for how far these places are from the venue).

**Close to Contact Theatre** (and the University) you'll find:

- [Big Hands] is right next to Contact Theatre. It's popular with local musicians and gig-goers, so gets busy after a gig at Manchester Academy. ([map][big hands map], 2 minute walk)

- [Kro BAR] is also very close, has **more room, and [serve food][kro menu]**. ([map][kro map], 3 minute walk)

- [The Salutation] is a decent size, and is run in partnership with Bollington Brewing co, who [make decent beer]. The Salutation is re-opening the night before the conference, just in time for the return of the MMU students! Could be busy… ([map][salutation map], 14 minute walk)

- [Sandbar] have an excellent choice of beers and whiskies, and serve decent pizza. It's popular with local academics and students, and has a good atmosphere. If it's too busy, try [The Deaf Institute] over the road. ([map][sandbar map], 14 minute walk)

**Slightly further towards the centre:**

- [North Bar] is a modern bar just off Oxford Road. An on-site restaurant called **Koto serve food** (see [menu][koto menu]). ([map][north bar map], 18 minute walk)

- [Lass O'Gowrie] is an old brick building on the banks of the River Medlock, halfway between Oxford Road and Piccadilly stations. It's known for its old tiles and fittings, and Guinness. They also do guest beers and **[serve food][lass o-gowrie menu]**. ([map][lass o-gowrie map], 20 minute walk)

- [YES bar] is next door to the Lass O'Gowrie. There's a bar on the ground floor (where you can get some **substantial bar snacks**) with music venues on other floors. They've got reasonably sized booths that should fit groups of 6, but it might get pretty noisy at the weekend. ([map][yes map], 20 minute walk)

- [Bundobust Brewery] is slightly further north. Being a Bundobust, they also **serve food**. Open 'til 10pm on Friday/Saturday, 8pm on Sunday. ([map][bundobust map], 20 minute walk)

**Nearer to the city centre**, these are all worth a mention:

- [The Gas Works Brewbar] is on the site of an old gas works and has a brewery on site. It's fairly spacious, they **[serve food][gas works menu]**, and you can play shuffleboard. ([map][gas works map], 25 minutes walk)

- [The Britons Protection] is a proper old pub with plenty of nooks and crannies. Dating back to 1795, there's some real history to it. It was used to recruit soldiers during the Napoleonic wars, and there are rumours that people injured in the 1819 Peterloo Massacre were treated on the bar. They've got a couple of hundred whiskeys to choose from. It's quite popular, so perhaps not ideal in the evening for large groups. ([map][bp map], 28 minute walk)

- [Peveril of the Peak] (a.k.a. "the Pev") is one of Manchester's most famous pubs, and dates back to 1830. It's known for the beautiful tile-clad frontage. Inside you'll find multiple rooms, stained glass, and some bench seating. The landlady has been there over 50 years, and there's a ghost! 👻 ([map][pev map], 26 minute walk)

- [City Arms] is just off St Peter's Square (so really quite central) and is a reliable choice. It's almost 200 years old, has a good atmosphere, and two rooms. There are normally several different beers on tap (including one vegan option), and around 150 gins. ([map][city arms map], 30 minute walk)

**If you'd like to seek out some live music** head for the Northern Quarter. [Night and Day] and [Soup Kitchen] are good bars that usually have bands playing at the weekend. Head to [Matt & Phred's] if you prefer Jazz. And if you're in the Northern Quarter in search of a good beer, try [The Castle] or [TROF].

**And finally, for the gamers**:

- [NQ64] is a neon-lit bar with retro arcade games and themed cocktails. There are two, one located [in the Northern Quarter][nq64 map], another [on Peter St][nq64 peter st]. Think Mario Kart, Street Fighter, and classic pinball. Open til 3am on Friday and Saturday – what could go wrong? ([map][nq64 map])

- [Pixel Bar] offers themed nights, PC and console gaming, and a fully stocked bar – ideal for a relaxed evening of gaming and geekery. In the Northern Quarter. Open til 1am. ([map][pixel map])
